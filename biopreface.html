<h1>A Few Quick Things:</h1>
<p>This practice exam is just over 200 questions and may take over an hour to complete.
<br>DO NOT CLOSE THIS TAB, OR YOUR PROGRESS WILL BE RESET. :(
<br><br>Make sure you download the PDF below, you will need it for the quiz. (split screen)
<br><br>If I made any mistakes, please let me know. I know there are one or two glitches you may encounter but the only thing I am concerned about is whether or not my information is accurate.
<br><br>And now, the best part...
<br>You'll get a score at the end!
<br>(Just make sure you don't click the 'Press if Correct' button more than one time or your score will mess up)
<br><br>Lastly, on the essay questions, DO NOT FORGET TO PRESS THE BUTTON (once per question, or like I said, it will mess up your score) IF YOU GOT IT RIGHT. IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY COUNT IT WRONG.
<br><br>By the way, if you want to use this site on your phone, it works there too. :)</p>
